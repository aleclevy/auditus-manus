# auditus-manus
This project uses a combination of Google's mediapipe and the pyaudio package to allow for hand coordinated audio mixing in realitime. 

Running this python file requires usage of a .wav file. Included in the songs folder is some lovely Nujabes (RIP). 

Feel free to use, edit, and share as desired. Credit is always appreciated. Cheers!
